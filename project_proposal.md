# Project Proposal: Simple Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## 1. Executive Summary
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are critical tools in network security, monitoring traffic to detect and respond to suspicious activities. This project aims to create a simple IDS using Python and Scapy that will detect basic malicious activities, such as SYN scans, brute-force attempts, and ICMP floods. The IDS will be a foundational model that offers a hands-on learning experience for students and beginner-level security enthusiasts.

## 2. Project Description
The proposed project focuses on developing a network-based IDS capable of capturing and analyzing packets on a local network. By utilizing Python and Scapy, the IDS will be able to identify suspicious patterns and generate alerts when certain attack signatures are detected. The IDS will be tested in a virtual environment, simulating typical network attacks. The output of the IDS will include real-time alerts and logs that detail detected anomalies.

## 3. Objectives
- Develop a network-based IDS using Python and the Scapy library.
- Capture and analyze network traffic to detect common malicious activities (e.g., SYN scans, ICMP requests).
- Generate alerts for any detected suspicious behavior.
- Document the entire process, providing insights into the functionality, limitations, and improvements of the IDS.

## 4. Scope
- **Network Monitoring**: The IDS will be restricted to monitoring traffic within a local controlled environment.
- **Packet Analysis**: The system will identify malicious activities by analyzing packet headers and contents.
- **Learning Tool**: This project is intended as a learning tool to explore basic IDS concepts and will not be suitable for enterprise-level deployment.

## 5. Methodology
The methodology involves the following phases:
1. **Research**: Conduct research on common IDS techniques, network threats, and Scapy.
2. **System Design**: Design the architecture of the IDS, outlining the main components such as packet capturing, analysis, and alert mechanisms.
3. **Development**: Implement the IDS using Python. Scapy will be used for packet capturing and analysis.
4. **Testing**: Test the IDS using simulated network attacks (e.g., using nmap to generate port scans).
5. **Documentation**: Document the entire development process, the tests conducted, and the results.

## 6. Expected Outcomes
- A functional IDS capable of capturing and analyzing packets on a local network.
- Real-time alerts for identified attacks (e.g., SYN scans, ICMP requests).
- A detailed project report covering the implementation process, testing results, and conclusions.

## 7. Timeline
The project will be completed over a period of 12 weeks:

## 9. Ethical Considerations
- All experiments will be conducted in a controlled environment to ensure no real network or users are impacted.
- Only simulated data will be used to avoid privacy violations.
- The project will adhere to all relevant legal and ethical guidelines.

## 10. Conclusion
The proposed IDS project will provide an understanding of the fundamentals of intrusion detection and network security. By creating a simple IDS, the project will demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of using open-source tools such as Python and Scapy to monitor and analyze network traffic. The IDS will serve as a foundational model that can be expanded with additional features, making it a valuable learning resource for those new to network security.
